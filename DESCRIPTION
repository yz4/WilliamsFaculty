Description: This package explores the data of the Williams faculty age, with special
             attention paid to two factors: department and gender. The package provides functions that generate 
             summary tables and functions that generate interesting visual presentations of the data. Some functions
             generate different summaries and plots depending on the user's input. In addition, the package also contains a 
             function that performs statistical analysis on the data.
